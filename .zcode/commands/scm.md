description: SCM workflow for Git operations (branching/merge/conflict/worktree) plus Conventional Commit execution.

- Follow `.agents/skills/_shared/core/execution-policy.md` for authorization and completion.
- Read `.agents/skills/oma-scm/SKILL.md`; its canonical path, guardrails, and push rules own Git execution. This workflow adds the decision checkpoint and optional documentation hook.
- Execute inline with native Git tools. User-facing language follows project configuration; Git/PR text stays in English.

## Step 1: Determine intent
Classify the request as advisory/operations or commit execution. Use existing authorization; do not create commits for an advisory-only request.

## Step 2: Inspect and route
Inspect the repository using the SCM skill. For large merges, apply its `resources/merge-risk.md` criteria and preserve a rollback path. Ask only for a material missing decision or unapproved risky action; explicit user instructions override workflow defaults.

## Step 3A: SCM advisory/operations
Follow the skill's configuration-management resources for the requested operation. Report the selected approach, affected refs, conflicts, checks, and remaining risks. Large-merge reports also include change footprint, risk buckets, merge order, and recovery checkpoints.

## Step 3B: Commit execution
1. Select commit groups using the skill's Transitions rules.
2. Record the actual grouping decision under the fixed subject `scm.commit-split`, then verify it:
   ```bash
   oma state emit "decision.made" '{"subject":"scm.commit-split","decision":"<actual commit groups>","rationale":"<why these changes belong together or apart>"}'
   oma state verify --workflow scm --checkpoint commit-split
   ```
   Use `.agents/skills/_shared/runtime/event-spec.md` for session binding and event transport. Replace placeholders with the decision made in this run.
3. Execute the skill's canonical commit path and, when requested, its Push and PR safety path.

## Step 3.5: Optional Doc Verify Hook
Only when `docs.auto_verify: true` in project configuration:
1. Run `oma docs verify --json` from the repository root.
2. Report a clean result or summarize broken references with their repair command. This hook is warn-only and does not block SCM completion.
3. If the command is unavailable, skip the optional hook; do not claim it passed.

## Step 4: Report result
Report the actual commit/branch/remote outcome, checks, and unresolved work. Use the skill's recovery rules for failures; do not report a rejected push or incomplete merge as completed.
